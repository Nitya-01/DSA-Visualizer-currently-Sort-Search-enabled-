To help you easily find your way through the DSA Visualizer, here’s a quick guide on navigating the interface:

- **Home**: The landing page where you can access the main features of the visualizer.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Click to explore various sorting algorithms. Each algorithm has a dedicated section that allows you to visualize how it works.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Navigate to the searching algorithms section to see visual representations of different searching techniques.
- **Settings**: Customize your visualization experience by adjusting settings such as speed, input size, toggle between dark and light mode, and more.

## Current Features

### Sorting Algorithms
Experience sorting algorithms in real time! The DSA Visualizer currently showcases:

- **Bubble Sort**: Watch elements bubble to their correct positions in an animated journey!
- **Insertion Sort**: Observe how each element seamlessly finds its place in a sorted array.
- **Selection Sort**: See how the smallest elements are selected and organized.
- **Merge Sort**: Witness the power of the divide-and-conquer strategy!
- **Quick Sort**: Explore the efficiency of the pivot method, brought to life!

### Searching Algorithms
Discover the thrill of finding elements with our dynamic visualizations:

- **Linear Search**: Enjoy a straightforward exploration of the list, one element at a time.
- **Binary Search**: Experience the speed of halving the search space to locate your target!

## User-Friendly Design
The DSA Visualizer boasts a colorful, modern interface designed to keep you engaged. With responsive design principles, it ensures a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile!
